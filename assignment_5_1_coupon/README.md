# Readme file for Practical Application Assignment 5.1: Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?

### Problem:

**Context**
Imagine driving through town and a coupon is delivered to your cell phone for a restaraunt near where you are driving. Would you accept that coupon and take a short detour to the restaraunt? Would you accept the coupon but use it on a sunbsequent trip? Would you ignore the coupon entirely? What if the coupon was for a bar instead of a restaraunt? What about a coffee house? Would you accept a bar coupon with a minor passenger in the car? What about if it was just you and your partner in the car? Would weather impact the rate of acceptance? What about the time of day?
Obviously, proximity to the business is a factor on whether the coupon is delivered to the driver or not, but what are the factors that determine whether a driver accepts the coupon once it is delivered to them? How would you determine whether a driver is likely to accept a coupon?

**Overview**
The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.

**Data**
This data comes to us from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then ask the person whether he will accept the coupon if he is the driver. Answers that the user will drive there ‘right away’ or ‘later before the coupon expires’ are labeled as ‘Y = 1’ and answers ‘no, I do not want the coupon’ are labeled as ‘Y = 0’. There are five different types of coupons -- less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carry out & take away, bar, and more expensive restaurants ($20 - $50).

### Data Description

### (I) Initial Setup and Data Set Cleanup / Transformation

I have used below steps and performed some cleanup and transformation on data set as listed out below:
1. Read csv data set into data frame.
2. Checked data set and missing or incorrect values
3. Performed correction to correct misspelled data values in the data set.
4. Performed cleanup to drop column(s) those have very high number of missing valies
5. Performed cleanup to drop few record where values were missing
6. Verified cleaned and transformed data set to ensure no further missing or incorrect values in the data set for further analysis.

### (II) Initial Data Analysis
 I have performed some initial analysis to see how different coupons are distributed as per their overall acceptance.

 **Observation** - Proportion of the total accepted coupon: 56.93%

**Visualization based on different types of the coupon**

### (III) Bar Coupon Analysis

I have performed analysis on the Bar Coupons as mentioned in the problem and below are the key observations:

**(a) What proportion of bar coupons were accepted?**

Proportion of bar coupons accepted out of total bar coupons: 41.19

<img src="images/Img02.png" alt="Figure 1.2" width="75%">

**(b) Compare the acceptance rate between those who went to a bar 3 or fewer times a month to those who went more**

Proportion of bar coupons accepted by those went to a bar 3 or fewer times : 81.35%

Proportion of bar coupons accepted by those went more : 18.65%

<img src="images/Img03.png" alt="Figure 1.3" width="75%">

**(c) Compare the acceptance rate between drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25 to the all others.**

Proportion of bar coupons accepted by drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25 : 38.61%

<img src="images/Img04.png" alt="Figure 1.4" width="75%">

**(d) Use the same process to compare the acceptance rate between drivers who go to bars more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry.**

Proportion of bar coupons accepted by drivers who go to a bar more than than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry : 71.43%

<img src="images/Img05.png" alt="Figure 1.5" width="75%">

Proportion of bar coupons accepted by other drivers group : 67.1%

<img src="images/Img06.png" alt="Figure 1.6" width="75%">

**(e) Acceptance rates between those drivers who - go to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and were not widowed**

Proportion of bar coupons accepted by this drivers group : 71.43%

<img src="images/Img07.png" alt="Figure 1.7" width="75%">

**(f) Acceptance rates between those drivers who - go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30**

### (IV) Independent Analysis

I have selected Coffee House coupon for independent analysis.

**(a) Load coffee house coupons in data frame**

As a first step, i have loaded coffee house coupons in the "coffeecoupon" data frame

**(b) Find out what proportion of coffee house coupons were accepted?**

As a first step, i have loaded coffee house coupons in the "coffeecoupon" data frameProportion of Coffee coupons accepted out of total coupons: 15.68

<img src="images/Img10.png" alt="Figure 1.10" width="75%">


**(c) Some initial analysis of coffee house coupons**

Bar plot for Coffee coupon with passenger to visualize distribution

<img src="images/Img11.png" alt="Figure 1.11" width="75%">

**Inference -**
Those go to Coffee House with friends and partner have higher rate of coupons acceptance in place of those go with kids or alone

**(d) Bar plot for Coffee coupon classified with to visualize** 

<img src="images/Img12.png" alt="Figure 1.12" width="75%">

**Inference -**
Those go to Coffee House in morning time has higher acceptance rate. After that those go to evening hours. Surprisingly those go with friends have higer acceptance rate in night hours.

**(e) Bar plot for Coffee coupon classified with Coffee house visit to visualize** 

<img src="images/Img13.png" alt="Figure 1.13" width="75%">

**Inference -**
This plot very clearly shows that those go with partner and more frequently have Highest coupon acceptanve rate. As red bar represents very frequency is greater than 8 , this group has highest rate of coupon acceptance.

**(f) Violin plot for Coffee coupon with gender and time as hue to visualize** 

<img src="images/Img14.png" alt="Figure 1.14" width="75%">

**Inference -**
This violin plot is showing that not much difference in coupon acceptance rate based on gender. But one trend is visible that acceptance arte is low those go in night hours.

**(g) Violin plot for Coffee coupon with gender and number of visits as hue to visualize** 

<img src="images/Img15.png" alt="Figure 1.15" width="75%">

**Inference -**
This plot vshows that those acceptance rate is bit higher among female even those go less frequently.

**(h) Box plot for Coffee coupon with martial status and gender as hue to visualize** 

<img src="images/Img16.png" alt="Figure 1.16" width="75%">

**Inference -**
This plot vshows that those acceptance rate is high in the group have martial status as Single, Married or Unmarried partner. Specially among females its High in unmarried partners.

**(i) Box plot for Coffee coupon with martial status and number of visits as hue to visualize** 

<img src="images/Img17.png" alt="Figure 1.17" width="75%">

**Inference -**
This plot vshows that those no major impact on acceptance rate between male and female based on frequncy of going to coffee house. Both genders have almost same acceptance.

**Independent Analysis Hypothesis**

Based on above analysis of the Coffee House coupons and multiple visualization, my inference for hypothesis is as below:
1) Acceptance rate highly depends on companion type. It's highest among friends and partners.
2) Acceptance rate also has significant impact baseed on time of the visit to coffee house. Generally it seems athat it is higher for morning and evening hours.
3) Acceptance rate is also higher among the people those go more to coffee house. It's Highest with frequent visitors as partners.
4) There is not much difference based on gender.
5) There are some impact based on martial status and it's higher among single, married partners and unmarried partners.
