# Practical Application III: Comparing Classifiers


In this practical application, our goal is to compare the performance of the classifiers we encountered in this section, namely K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. We will utilize a dataset related to marketing bank products over the telephone.

Our dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository link. The data is from a Portugese banking institution and is a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns. We make use of the article accompanying the dataset for more information on the data and features.

This dataset is from from a Portuguese bank that used its own contact-center to do directed marketing campaigns. The telephone, with a human agent as the interlocutor, was the dominant marketing channel, although sometimes with an auxiliary use of the Internet online banking channel (e.g. by showing information to specific targeted client). Furthermore, each campaign was managed in an integrated fashion and the results for all channels were outputted together.

The dataset collected is related to 17 campaigns that occurred between May 2008 and November 2010, corresponding to a total of 79354 contacts. During these phone campaigns, an attractive long-term deposit application, with good interest rates, was offered. For each contact, a large number of attributes was stored as shown in the below table.

In this practical application alos, we refer back to a standard process in industry for data projects called CRISP-DM to frame the task, throughout for understanding the business problem, understanding data, analysis and preparation, modeling, evaluation and deployment as described in the below figure.
